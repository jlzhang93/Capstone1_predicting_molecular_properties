# 1.	Project Background
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is an analytical chemistry technique used in quality control and research for determining the content and purity of a sample as well as its molecular structure. It shed light upon determination of molecular conformation in solution as well as study of physical properties at the molecular level such as conformational exchange, phase changes, solubility, and diffusion. 
Using NMR to gain insight into a molecule’s structure and dynamics depends on the ability to accurately predict J-couplings or Scalar couplings, which contains information about relative bond distances, angles and connectivity of chemical bonds. J-couplings reflect the magnetic interactions between a pair of atoms. The strength of this magnetic interaction depends on intervening electrons and chemical bonds that make up a molecule’s three-dimensional structure.  

It is possible to accurately calculate scalar coupling constants (J) given only a 3D molecular structure as input. However, these quantum mechanics calculations are extremely expensive (days or weeks per molecule), and therefore have limited applicability in day-to-day workflows.

A fast and reliable method to predict these interactions will allow medicinal and analytical chemists to gain structural insights faster and cheaper, enabling scientists to understand how the 3D chemical structure of a molecule affects its properties and behavior.

Ultimately, such tools will enable researchers to make progress in a range of important problems, like designing molecules to carry out specific cellular tasks, or designing better drug molecules to fight disease.

# 2. Project focus and potential clients
The focus of this Capstone Project would be to develop an algorithm that predict the scalar coupling constant. This project would help analytical chemists, pharmacologists, and physicists to better understand the fundamentals of chemical structures and relevant molecular properties. It could also give insights into streamlining chemical synthesis and characterization in industry.
